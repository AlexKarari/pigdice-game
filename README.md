# GAME OF THRONES: PIG DICE GAME!

## By Alexander Karari

## Description

_The game has 2 players, playing in rounds. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his/her round total. There is AN EXCEPTION: If the player rolls a 1, all his round total gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn. The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his round total gets added to his total score. After that, it's the next player's turn. The first player to reach 100 points on TOTAL score wins the game._
